# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game
Here's a breakdown of its functionality: || Includes necessary headers: Imports the iostream, cstdlib, and ctime libraries for input/output, random number generation, and time functions, respectively. || Game Loop:
Starts an infinite loop to continue the game until the user chooses to quit. || Prompts the user to enter their choice (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, 3 for Scissors, 0 to quit). Reads the user's input. || If the user chooses to quit (0), breaks out of the loop. Checks if the user's input is valid (between 1 and 3). If not, displays an error message and continues to the next iteration. || Generates a random computer choice. Displays the computer's choice. || Compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner: If they are the same, it's a tie. If the user's choice beats the computer's choice according to the rock-paper-scissors rules, the user wins. Otherwise, the computer wins. || Loop Continuation: The loop continues to the next iteration, prompting the user for another choice until they decide to quit. ||  Output: Displays the result of the round (tie, user win, or computer win).
